# gameDev_godotFantasyGame
Final assignment for Game Development paper, third year, semester 1 Bachelor of Applied Information Technology

This is my second and final project for the Game Development paper in my Bachelors degree. This was a collaborative project that harnessed all the knowledge gained throughout the paper so far. We were tasked with creating a game using Godot, going through the entire game development process from beginning to end, drawing on good game design practices and theory (See the Assignment Outline for more details). We were given creative freedom regarding the design of the game, type of game and mechanics implemented, as long as it was completed by the due date. This project was developed using the Godot platform and the GDScript programming language.

With our game we wanted it to have an open world fantasy RPG feel, with extra care taken to make the player feel immersed in the world we created. While we implemented some cool functional mechanics, we wanted to use our knowledge from the first project so decided to make it a 2D game, like the first project in our paper.

Below I will include a link to the Figma file that I used to help plan and design levels, using sprites from CraftPix.net:

Please note: As I cannot upload the executable file for the game I will upload a video of some gameplay ASAP. The game 'The Alchemist's Apprentice' has some bugs. As of my most recent testing (July 2024), the game crashes before the end credits and conclusion of the story. Specifically, after the final boss is killed, the trigger to the end credits and some other game mechanics seem to be broken. If you want to see more details about these particular areas of the games, please refer to the project files.
