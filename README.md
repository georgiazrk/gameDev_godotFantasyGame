# gameDev_godotFantasyGame
Final assignment for Game Development paper, third year, semester 1 Bachelor of Applied Information Technology

This is my second and final project for the Game Development paper in my Bachelors degree. This was a collaborative project that harnessed all the knowledge gained throughout the paper so far. We were tasked with creating a game using Godot, going through the entire game development process from beginning to end, drawing on good game design practices and theory (See the Assignment Outline for more details). 

Below I will include a link to the Figma file that I used to help plan and design levels, using sprites from CraftPix.net:

Please note: The executable file for the game 'The Alchemist's Apprentice' has some bugs. As of my most recent testing (July 2024), the game crashes before the end credits and conclusion of the story. Specifically, after the final boss is killed, the trigger to the end credits and some other game mechanics seem to be broken. If you want to see more details about these particular areas of the games, please refer to the project files.
